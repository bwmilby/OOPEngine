# OOPEngine

OOPEngine is a stack with code that implements some principles of OOP within
LiveCode where classes are defined and objects can be created and
manipulated.  The initial method used nested groups.  Since originally conceived,
behaviors have become more versatile and now nested behaviors can be
used to provide the desired effect without resorting to nesting groups.
